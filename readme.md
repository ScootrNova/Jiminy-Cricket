The only thing that this branch contains is the contents of the `wepaint-local.zip` file. If you want to try out WePaint but don't want to download it... well here you go.

Thanks for trying out a very old school group project of mine. :) Back when this thing had "multipainter" functionality it was a lot of fun.
