This directory should contain an exact working copy of the exact
structure of our website and nothing more. This file is the only
exception to that rule. If you put a file in here then it should
be pretty much immediately uploaded via SFTP to the server's
public_html folder and if a file exists on the server then it
should also definitely be in here.
Our website can be found at http://www.wepaint.us/
