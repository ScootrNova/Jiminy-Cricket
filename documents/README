All document files should go in this directory. This means that this directory
will most likely be like 95% .doc and .ppt files. Please avoid using the newer
word formats (.docx or .pptx) so that we can ensure compatibility with the
teacher and other students. If you use any images in your documents then they
should be placed in the /resources/ directory, not in here.
